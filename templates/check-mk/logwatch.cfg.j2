# Configuration of remote ips to a cluster name (refer to werk #7032 for more info):
# - cluster name: A line containing "CLUSTER" defines the scope of a cluster mapping.
#   For the logwatch configuration of a host several cluster configurations are allowed.
#   The name of a cluster must follow in the same line as "CLUSTER" and must be separated
#   with a single whitespace. The name must only consist of letters, digits, dash and
#   underscore and it must start with a letter or underscore. All cluster mapping
#   definitions in the logwatch configuration must have unique cluster names.
# - ip addresses or subnets (CIDR notation): Lines defining an ip address or subnet in
#   CIDR notation must begin with " ". IP addresses are
#   determined by the Checkmk Agent and may be IPv4 addresses in IPv4 notation,
#   IPv4 addresses extended to IPv6 notation and IPv6 addresses dependent on how the
#   Checkmk Agent is accessed. However this configuration file expects IPv4 notation
#   or IPv6 notation for cluster ip lookup. Subnets may be IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR notation.
